  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>My background is in linguistics, as both a Ph.D. student and as a Teaching Assistant</p>
    <p>What is linguistics? It is the study of languages including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Language Structure (grammar system, phonology/phonetics, semantics, etc.)</li>
      <li>Language and its use in society</li>
      <li>Language documentation and revitalization</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important!</strong> When I mention that I am a linguist, I have often been asked one of two questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How many languages do you speak?</li>
      <li>Am I speaking correctly? Will you be correcting my grammar?</li>
    </ol>
    <p> First, while I do speak a couple languages, I am mainly concerend in language <em>patterns.</em></p>
    <p> Second, linguistics is not concerned with <span class="distinction"> prescriptive </span> grammar. It is concerened with <span class= "distinction"> descriptive grammar; that is, <em>how</em> language is used. There is <strong>no</strong> wrong way to speak a language, nor is there a <strong>right</strong> way to speak.</p>

    <p>My research has focused on bilingualism, second language acquisition, and language change, but language as a whole is absolutely fascinating!</p>

  <h4>Hobbies and Current Interests </h4>
    <p>Reading, yoga, dancing (have dabbled in: fencing, archery, and knitting)</p>

        <li><span class="books">American Gods</span>, Neil Gaiman</li>

        <li><span class="books">Stranger in a Strange Land</span>, Robert Heinlein</li>
      </ol>
